I am getting following error message

E:Problem parsing dependency Depends
E:Error occurred while processing libv6-dev (NewVersion2)
E:Problem with MergeList /var/lib/dpkg/status
E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.


Fix
# replacing newer file with bak resolved issue
sudo mv /var/lib/dpkg/status /var/lib/dpkg/status.bak
sudo mv /var/lib/dpkg/status-old /var/lib/dpkg/status
